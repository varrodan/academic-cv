\chapter{Course Evaluation Results for ECSE 321 (W18)}

This appendix reproduces the complete set of comments from the ECSE 321 course which I received right after I initiated the modernization of software technologies used within the course. The course is a required course in the Software Engineering and Computer Engineering curriculum, as well as in the Software Engineering Minor selected by electrical engineers and mechanical engineers. As such, in each semester, the course receives some 75-100 students with a very different background, but with very little knowledge of software technologies of industrial relevance. While most of the students have completed one or two programming courses, this is the first time that they have to work on a real (complex) software engineering project.
