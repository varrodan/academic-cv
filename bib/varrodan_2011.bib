  abstract = { Systems based on the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles
	have become an important cornerstone of the development of enterprise-scale
	software applications. They are characterized by separating functions
	into distinct software units, called services, which can be published,
	requested and dynamically combined in the production of business
	applications. Service-oriented systems (SOSs) promise high flexibility,
	improved maintainability, and simple re-use of functionality. Achieving
	these properties requires an understanding not only of the individual
	artifacts of the system but also their integration. In this context,
	non-functional aspects play an important role and should be analyzed
	and modeled as early as possible in the development cycle. In this
	paper, we discuss modeling of nonfunctional aspects of service-oriented
	systems, and the use of these models for analysis and deployment.
	Our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we show how services
	and service compositions may be modeled in UML by using a profile
	for SOA (UML4SOA) and how non-functional properties of service-oriented
	systems can be represented using the non-functional extension of
	UML4SOA (UML4SOANFP) and the MARTE profiles. This enables modeling
	of performance, security and reliable messaging. Second, we discuss
	formal analysis of models which respect this design, in particular
	we consider performance estimates and reliability analysis using
	the stochastically-timed process algebra PEPA as the underlying analytical
	engine. Last but not least, our models are the source for the application
	of deployment mechanisms which comprise model-to-model and model-to-text
	transformations implemented in the framework VIATRA. All techniques
	presented in this work are illustrated by a running example from
	an eUniversity case study. },

	(a) requirements or behavior of user models (on the model-level),
	and (b) the operational semantics of modeling languages (on the meta-level)
	as demonstrated by benchmark applications around the Unified Modeling
	Language (UML). The current paper focuses on the model checking-based
	automated formal verification of graph transformation systems used
	either on the model-level or meta-level. We present a general translation
	that inputs (i) a metamodel of an arbitrary visual modeling language,
	(ii) a set of graph transformation rules that defines a formal operational
	semantics for the language, and (iii) an arbitrary well-formed model
	instance of the language and generates a transitions system (TS)
	that serve as the underlying mathematical specification formalism
	of various model checker tools. The main theoretical benefit of our
	approach is an optimization technique that projects only the dynamic
	parts of the graph transformation system into the target transition
	system, which results in a drastical reduction in the state space.
	The main practical benefit is the use of existing back-end model
	checker tools, which directly provides formal verification facilities
	(without additional efforts required to implement an analysis tool)
	for many practical applications captured in a very high-level visual
	notation. The practical feasibility of the approach is demonstrated
	by modeling and analyzing the well-known verification benchmark of
	dining philosophers both on the model and meta-level.},
