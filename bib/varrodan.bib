	have become an important cornerstone of the development of enterprise-scale
	software applications. They are characterized by separating functions
	into distinct software units, called services, which can be published,
	requested and dynamically combined in the production of business
	applications. Service-oriented systems (SOSs) promise high flexibility,
	improved maintainability, and simple re-use of functionality. Achieving
	these properties requires an understanding not only of the individual
	artifacts of the system but also their integration. In this context,
	non-functional aspects play an important role and should be analyzed
	and modeled as early as possible in the development cycle. In this
	paper, we discuss modeling of nonfunctional aspects of service-oriented
	systems, and the use of these models for analysis and deployment.
	Our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we show how services
	and service compositions may be modeled in UML by using a profile
	for SOA (UML4SOA) and how non-functional properties of service-oriented
	systems can be represented using the non-functional extension of
	UML4SOA (UML4SOANFP) and the MARTE profiles. This enables modeling
	of performance, security and reliable messaging. Second, we discuss
	formal analysis of models which respect this design, in particular
	we consider performance estimates and reliability analysis using
	the stochastically-timed process algebra PEPA as the underlying analytical
	engine. Last but not least, our models are the source for the application
	of deployment mechanisms which comprise model-to-model and model-to-text
	transformations implemented in the framework VIATRA. All techniques
	presented in this work are illustrated by a running example from
	an eUniversity case study. },

	automated formal verification of graph transformation systems used

	that inputs (i) a metamodel of an arbitrary visual modeling language,
	(ii) a set of graph transformation rules that defines a formal operational
	semantics for the language, and (iii) an arbitrary well-formed model
	instance of the language and generates a transitions system (TS)

	approach is an optimization technique that projects only the dynamic
	parts of the graph transformation system into the target transition
	system, which results in a drastical reduction in the state space.
	The main practical benefit is the use of existing back-end model
	checker tools, which directly provides formal verification facilities
	(without additional efforts required to implement an analysis tool)
	for many practical applications captured in a very high-level visual

	are frequently projected into various mathematical domains (such
	as Petri nets, transition systems, process algebras, etc.) to carry
	out a formal analysis of the system under design by \emph{automatic
	model transformations}. Automation surely increases the quality of
	such transformations as errors manually implanted into transformation
	programs during implementation are eliminated; however, conceptual
	flaws in transformation design still remain undetected. In this paper,
	we present a model-level, modeling language independent and highly
	automated technique to formally verify by model checking that a model
	transformation from an arbitrary well-formed model instance of the
	source modeling language into its target equivalent preserves (language
	specific) dynamic consistency properties. We demonstrate the feasibility

  abstract = {Despite the large variety of existing graph transformation tools,
	the implementation of their pattern matching engine typically follows
	the same principle. First a matching occurrence of the left-hand
	side of the graph transformation rule is searched by some graph pattern
	matching algorithm. Then potential negative application conditions
	are checked that might eliminate the previous occurrence. However,
	when a new transformation step is started, all the information on
	previous matchings is lost, and the complex graph pattern matching
	phase is restarted from scratch each time. In the paper, we present
	the foundational data structures and initial experiments for an incremental
	graph pattern matching engine which keeps track of existing matchings
	in an incremental way to reduce the execution time of graph pattern
	matching.},

  abstract = { The IST-FET Integrated Project Sensoria is developing a novel comprehensive
	approach to the engineering of service-oriented software systems
	where foundational theories, techniques and methods are fully integrated
	into pragmatic software engineering processes. The techniques and
	tools of Sensoria encompass the whole software development cycle,
	from business and architectural design, to quantitative and qualitative
	analysis of system properties, and to transformation and code generation.
	The Sensoria approach takes also into account reconfiguration of
	service-oriented architectures (SOAs) and re-engineering of legacy
	systems. In this paper we give first a short overview of Sensoria
	and then present a pattern language for augmenting service engineering
	with formal analysis, transformation and dynamicity. The patterns
	are designed to help software developers choose appropriate tools
	and techniques to develop service-oriented systems with support from
	formal methods. They support the whole development process, from
	the modelling stage to deployment activities and give an overview
	of many of the research areas pursued in the Sensoria project. },
