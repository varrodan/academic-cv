The following tables report technological self-evaluations of students conducted in the form of online polls. The same questionnaire was voluntarily filled by students twice: once during the first lecture and once during the final lecture. My goal is two-fold (1) to assess the entry level of students related to key technologies covered in a course and (2) to obtain a technical feedback about the technological progress of students during the course.

\noindent
The results can be interpreted as follows:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5cm]
\item \textbf{ECSE 321:} In both editions, at the beginning of the semester, students were only familiar with Java and 
somwhat familiar with coding conventions and UML. By the end of the semester the technological level of students was 
lower than 3.0 for all technologies (except for Android in Winter 2019 which was turned into an optional project deliverable 
due to scheduling constraints) and below 2.0 for 5 out of 10 technologies (i.e. better than at least somewhat familiarity). 
Students had an improvement over 1.0 (out of a 5 point Likert scale) for 8 out of 10/11 technologies. It is very important to 
emphasize that students were totally unfamiliar with 5 out of 10 technologies in the beginning (with a score over 4.0), and 
they could simultaneously make technological progress in most of the technologies. 

\item \textbf{ECSE 429:} Again, major technological improvement has been made by students in most of the key 
technologies covered in the tutorials of the course, especially, in the case, when students had to use a given technology in 
the context of a complex software quality assurance project. Technological progress exceeded 0.5 (on a 1 to 4 scale) for 5 
out of 7 technologies, and students only had difficulties in acquiring end-to-end browser testing technologies.
\end{itemize}
